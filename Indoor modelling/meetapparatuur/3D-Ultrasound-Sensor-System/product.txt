Toposens is developing a 3D sensor system that generates very accurate position data (5 â€“ 10 mm) of objects within the area 
of 30 cm to 8 m without any time lag. We intend to achieve at least 1.000 -3.000 points with 30-120 frames per second.
This completely new method of positioning generates new ways in the sensor technology due to the possibility of seeing
the world via sound as a digital image in real time.
In addition to the excellent accuracy of our sensor system, it is characterized by high robustness, energy efficiency
and the small size. It gives the sensor system of Toposens the perfect requirements to be integrated into various technologies
and to open up new fields of applications.
